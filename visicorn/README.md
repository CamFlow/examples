# Example programs for visicorn

## Many read

We expect the graph to have some unique patterns at the start.

A lot of repeating patterns for most of the program.

Some unique patterns at the end.

[see code](many_read.c)

## Many read one write

It should looks like many read, but with some unique patterns in the middle.

[see code](many_read_one_write.c)

## Many read socket thing

Same as above, but should have a larger anomaly in the middle.

[see code](many_read_socket_things.c)
